# Associated data and code

The files in this code repository are commented versions of the code used for the following work:

_The Integrated Vehicle and Pollster Routing Problem_ by Sandra Gutiérrez, Andrés Miniguano-Trujillo, Diego Recalde, Luis M. Torres, Ramiro Torres.

## Main files in this repository

* [`ReadMe.md`](README.md): This file.
* [`Combinatorial Optimization at Work`](Combinatorial%20Optimization%20At%20Work): Folder containing working examples presented at [CO@Work – TU Berlin](https://co-at-work.zib.de/berlin2020/).
* [`Gallery GYE`](Gallery%20GYE): Folder containing additional visualisations of the solution for the big instance based on information collected at Guayaquil.

Most of the reported results were obtained using Gurobi 8.

* [`Points of Interest.ipynb`](Points%20of%20Interest.ipynb): Samples 467 points of interest from OpenStreetMaps using OSMnx (2019). The code relies on the [`connect_poi.py`](connect_poi.py) file based on a previous version of Yuwen Chang's code in
[`ywnch/toolbox`](https://github.com/ywnch/toolbox/tree/e5c0b59556d4346cb4de6f716eaa0b9d2d9f354c).
Data is stored in file [`poi.gpkg`](poi.gpkg) [Documentation in Spanish]

* [`Sampling.ipynb`](Sampling.ipynb): Artificial instance generator uses data from the points of interest collected in `poi.gpkg` to generate an instance with η stores. [Documentation in Spanish]
* 




Jupyter notebooks with code for [...] are included.
